    "# Defining an ABM model\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ABM` structure contains all the information of a ABM Based model, their parameters and rules of evolution. There are four elements to take into account when defining agents:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Parameters**. These can be splited in:\n",
    "    - User-defined parameters: Parameters that are defined for the specific model that is being used.\n",
    "    - Default parameters: Parameters that are defined for all models by default.\n",
    " - **Update rules**. Rules that describe the behavior of the agents during the course of time.\n",
    " - **Model inheritance**. More simple models over which we want to build more complex models.\n",

    "```julia\n",
    "ABM(dim,kwArgs...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `dim` is the only required argument of the model and defined the dimensionality of the agent and can take values 0-3. The `kwArgs` are keyword arguments that define the parameters, rules and base models of the present model and that will be seing in detail in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters - Default Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, all agent models have a set of defined set of parameters. A list of the most relevant parameters for a user is:\n",
    "\n",
    "|**Topic**|**Symbol**|**dtype**|**Description**|\n",
    "|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|\n",
    "|**Time**|t|Float64|Absolute time of evolution of the community.|\n",
    "||dt|Float64|Time increments in each step of the evolution.|\n",
    "|**Size Community**|N|Int64|The number of agents active in the community.|\n",
    "||NMedium|Vector{Int64}|Size of the grid in which the medium is being computed. This is necessary to be declared if medium parameters are declared by the user.|\n",
    "|**Id tracking**|id|Int64|Unique identifier of the agent.|\n",
    "|**Simulation space**|simBox|Matrix{Float64}|Simulation box in which cells are moving. This is necessary to define a region of space in which a medium will be simulated or for computing neighbors with CellLinked methods.|\n",
    "|**Position**|x|Vector{Float64}|Position of the agent in the x axis.|\n",
    "||y|Vector{Float64}|Position of the agent in the y axis.|\n",
    "||z|Vector{Float64}|Position of the agent in the z axis.|\n",
    "|**Position Medium**|x $_m$|Array{Float64}|Position of the medium gridpoints in the x axis. The shape will depend on the dimensionality o the model. This parameter is only present is a model with medium parameters is declared.|\n",

    "|**Grid size Medium**|dx|Float64|Grid separation of the medium in the x axis. This parameter is only present is a model with medium parameters is declared.|\n",
    "||dy|Float64|Grid separation of the medium in the y axis. This parameter is only present is a model with medium parameters is declared.|\n",
    "||dz|Float64|Grid separation of the medium in the z axis. This parameter is only present is a model with medium parameters is declared.|\n",

A complete list can be seen in the definition of the `Community` structure in `API`. You can identify them because they have a lower underscore in the end of their name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters - User defined parmaeters\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the default parameters, the user can define other parameters necessary for its model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The user parameters can have three scopes:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **model**: Parameters that affect all the agents. These can be scalars or arrays of any shape.\n",
    " - **agent**: Parameters have a different value for each agent. These will be stored as length N vectors. These can be scalars.\n",
    " - **medium**: Parameters that belong to the medium in which the model is embedded (if there is a medium defined for this model). These can be scalars only.\n",
    "\n",
    "For declaring the parameters, you will have to pass a dictionary-like object with keys as symbols of the parameters and datatypes as the stored values. Alternatively you can provide a structure and the `ABM` object will take the fields as the parameters."

    " 1. Parameters with double lower underline. If you notice, the update rule shows that when the modified parameters `x` and `l`, when reasiged with an updating operator, they where converted into `x__` and `l__`, respectively. The underscore variables are the variables that store the modifications of the parameters before making the final step. This is performed this way to avoid modificating the parameters before all the modifications to all the agents, medium and model parameters are made. When calling the functions `update!` or `evolve!`, the new modifications will take place and will be incorporated into the original parameters. \n",
    " 2. Random numbers and GPU. To generate random numbers from distributions we can use the package `Distributions.jl`. This is perfectly fine if your code is going to run only on CPU. However, `Distributions.jl` is not compatible with GPU hence we provide the submodule `CBMRandom` with some random generators from different distributions that may run both in CPU and GPU.\n",
    " 3. Macros. `CellBasedModels` provide several macros that are handy to perform some special functions of Agent Based Models. You can see the all the provided macros in `API - Macros`. In here we use the macro for adding agents to a model `@addAgent` and the one for removing agents `@removeAgent`.\n",

Similarly what we do with rules adding a double underscore, we mark differential terms with the function `dt`, this function defines that this parameter is described by a differential equation and a new parameter is added to define that this variable is the differential term.\n",
    " 2. ODE and SDE. We put the deterministic term un the rule `agentODE` and the stochatic term in the rule `agentSDE`. We may not have a deterministic term or no stochastic term, that is not a problem.\n",
    " 3. Use of neighbors macros. To go over the neighbors of an agent, we use the `@loopOverNeighbors` macro that requires that you specify an iterator index. Inside neighbors macros, you need to make a difference to which parameters are from the agent and which are the neighbors agent. If you see the line where the euclidean distance is computed you will realise that we specify the parameters of the second agent by providing the corresponding index of the neighboring position to them.\n",
