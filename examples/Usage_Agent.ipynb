    "# Defining an Agent model\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Agent` structure contains all the information of a Agent Based model, their parameters and rules of evolution. There are four elements to take into account when defining agents:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Parameters**. These can be splited in:\n",
    "    - User-defined parameters: Parameters that are defined for the specific model that is being used.\n",
    "    - Default parameters: Parameters that are defined for all models by default.\n",
    " - **Update rules**. Rules that describe the behavior of the agents during the course of time.\n",
    " - **Model inheritance**. More simple models over which we want to build more complex models.\n",

    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "Agent(dim,kwArgs...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `dim` is the only required argument of the model and defined the dimensionality of the agent and can take values 0-3. The `kwArgs` are keyword arguments that define the parameters, rules and base models of the present model and that will be seing in detail in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The agents parameters have several scopes:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Global**: Parameters that affect all the agents.\n",
    " - **Local**: Parameters have a different value for each agent.\n",
    " - **Medium**: Parameters that belong to the medium in which the model is embedded (if there is a medium defined for this model).\n",

    "### Parameters - Default Parameters\n",
